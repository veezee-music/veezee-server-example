## How to use

If using Apache, enable mod_rewrite and mod_headers in `httpd.conf`.

Install dependencies using Composer with command `composer install`. Now You'll need a server that supports `.htaccess` such as Apache 2.4. You can then create a virtual host and set its root directory to `/wwwroot` of this project.

Then go to `wwwroot/` and rename the `example-content` folder to `content`. Also in `wwwroot` rename the `.example-htaccess` to `.htaccess` and then open it and change line 31 to match your setup (local address in which you configured Apache to run veezee server).

Then go to  `/config` and rename `example-app-config.php` to `app.config.php` and if you want to use Google sign in, delete `example-client_secret.json` and replace it with the `client_secret.json` file provided by Google.

Finally go to `/app` and rename `example-cache` folder to `cache`.
